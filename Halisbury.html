A small tour bus suddenly appeared. Its loud engine broke the silence. Deeper into nowhere, it traveled past farms, cattle and crops. The white bus turned into a dirt path kicking up dust. The engine strug gled along the rough terrain as it maneuvered around rocks, cacti and dead branches.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Over a slope, the bus headed down into a valley toward a large river that ran along alongline of flimsy wooden shacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">The bus stopped abruptly at the end of Main Street. The Mexican driver stared through the dirty windshield at the dead town. He pulled out a shiny crucifix from beneath his soaked t-shlrt andmumbled a short prayer to the Vir gin Mary.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Along the side of the bus were the words &quot;Southwest Texas Ghost Town Tours&quot;.The double leaf doors popped open. The tour guide who wore a cowboy outfit stepped out.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Okay folks. Right this way. Please watch your step.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">One by one, twelve passengers unloaded with their various cameras and paper brochures.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The Mexican driver slammed the door shut, locking himself in. Sweating, he looked up at the sun for comfort. There were at least twohours of daylight left.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">His heart pounded in his ears. He reached underneath the seat and pulled out a bottle of tequila. Quickly, he took a shot to calm his nerves.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Welcome to Halisbury. or I should say what&#39;s left ofit,&quot; the tour guide began his rehearsed speech. The group withtheir cameras in band,followed the guide alongthe dirt road.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;For thousands of years this land belonged to the Native Americans and their ancestors.&quot; cameras clicked as they passed a burnt out church, its cross broken into pieces.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;But then came the Spanish and the French...&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The group passed a jail, doctor&#39;s office, hotel, saloon and general store. All the buildings were gray and faded with shattered windows and doors that were barely banging onto their hinges.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;...followed by the Mexicans.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">A heavy wind blew through the cracks andcrevices of the creaking structures, bringing about the smell of death.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;And finally, the Americans who built this town backin 1849.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Ashort, chubby kid stopped longenough to pick up a tooth. Long and sharp, it was covered withdried blood. uFor twenty-five years it grew as the Indian population declined.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The chubbykid showed his fat mother the tooth. She grimaced, then knocked it out of his hand, &quot;That was until 1874...&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Thetour guide looked beyond his customers toward the black hills in the dis tance. Amammoth cave stared</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">back and gave him a chill. &quot;...when they we1einvaded.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Year:1874. Night.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Tlility feet below in a valley, two cowboys sat around a campfire. Twenty yards awayin the fog, their cattle fedalong the river.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">So, what&#39;s the hurry?&quot; Neal asked while takinga swig from a whiskey bottle. &quot;We could get killed coming this way.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">His trail boss, Dalton,looked up from the fire where he was cooking fish.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;If we don&#39;t get these cattle to town before noon tomonow, we&#39;ll have more than Indians to worry about.&quot; &quot;What&#39;re you talkingabout?&quot; Neal asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">11colonel sharp,&quot; Dalton said. &quot;The Butcher?!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;That&#39;s right. Cut down twenty Indians one time with only his sword. There</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">was nothing left but pieces.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Neal rubbed his throat, &quot;Then maybe we shouldn&#39;t wait. Just to be safe.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;No. There&#39;s plenty of time.&quot;Daltonlooked up at the full moon.&quot;All we have to dois make it through the night.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Deep inside the bowels of a cave, a mechanical door opened. A green light spiralled through the darkness. High pitch shrieks echoed off the walls. Mcavy footsteps ran toward the cave&#39;s opening.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">At the cliff&#39;s edge, winged figures leaped out into the night.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The wind suddenly picked up. Pots and pans clanked against one another in the chuck wagon. Two tied up horses started to kick and stomp, tryingto free themselves from their harnesses.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Astrong gust blew through, wiping out the campfire. &quot;What in the hell?&quot; Dalton said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">In the dense fog, the cattle suddenly went crazy. Neal dropped his bottle, shatteringit. &quot;I toldyou we shouldn&#39;t have c.ome this way!&quot; he muttered.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Shut the fuck up!&quot; Dalton ordered.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Under the moonlight, the two cowboys pulled out their pistols and ran to ward the cattle cries. In the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">roamingfog, they lost oneanother.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Dalton?&quot; Neal&#39;s voice trembled. In the darkness, he tripped over something big. He found himself face to face with a dead calf. Blood covered the whole body, especially aroundthe throat that bad been ripped out. &quot;Dalton!&quot; Neal screamed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">While running, trying to find Dalton, Neal saw another cow on its side still kicking. But this time its attacker was there, feeding. Nealfired six times into the invader&#39;s backside, pissing it off The seven-foot creature stood up and charged..</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Neal tried to reload, but dropped his bullets. When he looked up again, a fist the size of his head, hit him in the jaw, knocking himfifteen feet intothe air.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">on his back and barely conscious, Neal opened his blurry eyes finding mas sive jaws opening near bis face.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Large, jagged teeth appeared and dug into his throat. Neal&#39;s scream was muffled, barely audible to Dalton.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Dalton followed the sound of his hired hand&#39;s cry for help. He gasped as he spotted what was left of Neal. The dead man&#39;s face was full of horror, his mouthlocked in a scream and dilated eyes bulging out of his head.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Damn Indians!&quot; Dalton yelled as he took off his hat and tossed it to the ground, rubbing his bead. suddenly</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">the sounds of the wind seemed to in crease above him as he peered into the dark night.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">He could barely make out the beings above him. Giant wings were flapping on what appeared to be two strange creatures levitating in the moonlight. Their red eyes gleamed in the moonlight and focused in on him. He gasped as he grabbed bis pistol and fired at the creatures. Realizing his bullets wci-e use less, Dalton made a break for the chuck wagon.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Near the chuck wagon, he dropped his gun and raced toward the horses. Jumpingand kicking, the twofrightened beasts brokefree just before the cow boy could reach them. Quickly, they galloped into the darkness as flapping wings approached.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Come back here, you sons-of-bitches!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">chasing after the steeds, Dalton suddenly felt bis boots being lifted off the ground. High and higher he was pulled up above the treetops and intothe hills.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The cowboy was dropped near the cave. He landed hard on the edge of a cliff. But before he could stand up, two creatures snared him by the boots and dragged him into the cave.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Desperate, Dalton clawed at the dirt as his screams echoed throughout the cave and thenvanished.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Halisbury: the next morning.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">The sun blazed over the wide river where the horses drankandthe towngath ered water,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Marshall Jim North squatted down by the river&#39;s edge, but didn&#39;t drink. Instead, he admired wildflowers along the shore. Soon, he picked a handful. Their smell brought a smile to his face.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Withflowersin hand, North headed into the busy town where workers strung up a white banner across main street:</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">HALIBURY&#39;S 25th ANNUAL CELEBRATION CIRCUS AND DANCE</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The sound of hammers and saws filled the air as the town prepared for the event.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Along main street, a small band practiced marching with their instruments. blaring. The hotel and saloon were getting a new paint job. Everyone was in a hurry, except for North who casually strolled through the mayhem.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Howdy,&quot; North said to each citizen who rushed by him.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">At the end of town, North crossed the crowded street toward the general store.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North entered, finding the floors and counters overstocked with all kinds of goods. Rose Walker was vigorously putting away merchandise tluoughout the store.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North waited to be noticed, but Rose didn&#39;t hear the door shut. &quot;Howdy, Rose,&quot; he said. &quot;Oh, morning Jim,&quot; she said, not looking up from her work. &quot;Nice day.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;ls it?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Hot though. Must be a hundred degr-ees,&quot; North exaggerated. &quot;Why, Jim,didn&#39;t they have summers in New York?&quot; Rose teased. &quot;Not like this.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Welcome to Texas, Mister North.&quot; Rose pointed to a pitcher fulloflemonade on the counter.&quot;Help yourself. It only getshotter.n</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North held up the flowers, &quot;I thought you might like these.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Rose,glanced back for onlya second, &quot;They&#39;re beautiful Would you set them on the counter?»</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">A little disappointed, North set them next to the lemonade. He grabbed the pitcher and poured a glass. &quot;Seems you&#39;re busy,&quot; be said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Very.There&#39;s still so much to do before Saturday.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">North looked around at all the merchandise. &quot;Looks like you have plenty to sell.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;And that&#39;s what I plan to do. There will be a lot of people here from all over the county.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll dofine.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Lord knows this town needs it. Things just haven&#39;t been the same since the war ended,&quot; she said. North walked over to her. Like the wildflowers, he appreciated her beauty.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Speaking of Saturday...that&#39;s why I came by. See, they&#39;re having this dance and I was wondering...&quot; suddenly, a young boy, around eight years old burst into the room, swinging a wooden sword.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Hey, Mark,&quot; North said. &quot;Howdy, Marshal!&#39;&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Maybe,&quot; Rose tried not to laugh. &quot;You did?&quot; North was fuming. Rose shrugged, &quot;What was I supposed to do? You didn&#39;t bother.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">••well rm bothering now,&quot; he said while picking up the flowers. &quot;That&#39;s what these are for.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose kept supplying the shelves. &quot;Does that mean you&#39;re going to ask soon?&quot; North took offhis hat, &quot;If you&#39;ll let me.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Rose kept her back to him, &quot;I&#39;m waiting.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North wasfrustrated. &quot;Could you please stop that long enough for me to ask?&quot; Rose stopped and turned around.

The black mare&#39;s hooves thun dered along main street kicking</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">up dust. Barely alive, Dalton couldn&#39;t control the frightened beast.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">The busy street suddenly panicked as men and women ran to avoid being trampled.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">In front of the store, Mark fought Indians along the sidewalk. While cutting and stabbing at the air, the imaginative boy sauntered out into the middle of the road.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">A female onlooker spotted him and dropped her groceries. &quot;Watch out!&quot; she screamed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose was displaying an evening dress in the front window when she saw the horse heading straight for her son.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Hearing her scream, Northran to the window.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Mark turned and saw the giant beast. Paralyzed with fear, he dropped his sword.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North threw open the door and ran out, colliding with the hitching post. He flipped over, landing hard on his back.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">In the Mayor&#39;s office, Colonel White hadheard Rose&#39;s screams. Mark closed bis eyes as he awaited the inevitable collision. &quot;Marl&lt;!&quot; she helplessly shrieked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Five feet from being crushed, White grabbed the boy and threw him to the side. Just inches from the Colonel&#39;s boots, the mare sped by, slicing Mark&#39;s wooden swordin half.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Rose pushed past North andembraced her son.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">In his office, Doc Jones heard the commotion andlooked out the window, see ing a runaway horse coming</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">his way.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Calmly, the man with a derby and spectacles walked out into the middle of the road with a shotgun. With the horse bearing down on him, he checked his gun to make sure it was loaded.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Just feet away, Doc fired into the air!The frightened horse skidded to a stop and reared up, throwing the rider.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North appeared, dragging the fallen cowboy away from the horse&#39;s jabbing hooves.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Soon, the two men lassoed the beast and after a short struggle, they forced it intoa nearby stable.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Doc joined North&#39;s side.The menlookeddown at the dying cowboy. &quot;They&#39;re coming,&quot; Dalton whispered. In the doctor&#39;s office, the cowboy lay motionless in a bed. Doc put bis handon the man&#39;s bead as North watched.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">&quot;He&#39;s cold as ice,&quot; Doc said. &quot;What&#39;s wrong withhim, Doc?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not sure,but he&#39;s pretty sick.n &quot;They&#39;re coming,&quot; Dalton said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">North leaned over. &quot;Who&#39;s coming?&quot; he implored.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">colonel White barged into the room wearing his saber. The door slammed be hind him.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Indians, of course,&quot; White said. &quot;We can handle this,&quot; North said. &quot;Like the way you handled the boy back there?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North stood up and faced White muttering, &quot;Why don&#39;t you go back to your fort where youbelong?&quot; &quot;Thjs is my post!&quot; White shouted. &quot;And my town!&quot; North snid angrily.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">White pushed by North and stood by the side of the bed. He looked down at the sick cowboy without anysympathy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Where&#39;s mycattle, Dalton?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The cowboy choked and coughed, &quot;They&#39;re dead, sir. All dead.n White&#39;s eyes grew hard.&quot;Where?!&quot; &quot;Near Devil&#39;s Cave.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;You fool!That&#39;s Indiancountry1&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;We triedto cut through. Save time,&quot; Dalton said. &quot;There was someone with you?&quot; Doc asked. Dalton nodded, &quot;Neal But they cut his throat.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">White stomped his boot onto the wooden floor, kicking updust,&quot;Damn Indi ans ain&#39;t nothing but trouble. This</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">town spent good money on those animals and the celebration is only days away.&quot; &quot;We&#39;know!&quot; North snapped.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Can you tell us what happened?&quot; Doc asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The cowboy licked his dry lips as he struggled to speak, &quot;I remember the cave. There was this light. Some smoke too. Shapes and shadows. Reminded me of angels.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;He&#39;s out of his mind,nWhite barked. &#39;&#39;Let&#39;im speak,&quot; North demanded. &quot;Went through some tunnels. Into a room. Felt this sting on my neck. This</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">horrible...&quot; The cowboy&#39;s eyes widened in horror. His hands clawed at the red bandana around his neck. &quot;No!&quot; Dalton kicked and thrashed about. &quot;God help me!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The three men tried to restrain the frightened cowboy but his strength was enormous. Doc and North were thrown to the floor while White was pushed into a wall</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Angry, white pulled his saber, but North stood up and blocked his way. &quot;Put that away,&quot; North ordered.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc rushed back to the cowboy who suddenly collapsed on the bed. His head snapped back over the edge. His last breath whispered out as his eyes faded to black.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc looked up at North and White. He reached down and untied the ban- danna. It fell to the floor. Doc stood up.&quot;Sweet Jesus!&quot; he exclaimed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North moved in for a closer look.&quot;What is that, Doc?&quot; &quot;Where&#39;s Father Malone?&quot; Doc asked. &quot;He&#39;sover at the Mission with the Savages,&quot; White said.&quot;Why?&quot; &quot;This wasn&#39;t any Indian attack.» &quot;What?&quot; White said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;ve seen thisbefore in Europe.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Doc?&quot; Is it some kind of animal?&quot; Northasked. Doc lookeddown at the huge gash in the dead man&#39;s neck. &quot;Vampires.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Below Devil&#39;s cave a small squadron of soldiers protected North, Doc, and White as they investigated the campsite area,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">There were dead cattle everywhere. The chuck wagon had been destroyed and debris was scattered all over the area.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Vampires?(&quot; White said to Doc while holding his arms out.&quot;Did this?&quot; White shook his bead. &quot;What are you? Some kind of witch doctor?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I know what I&#39;m talking about,&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Do you? well tell us, doctor, have you ever seen any of these creatures be fore? These vampires of yours?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">White asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Yes. over in France I had a patient who was bitten just like the cowboy. Within hours he was dead. Or at least I thought so.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;He turned into a vampire?&quot; White asked. &quot;And tried to rip my throat out,&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Doc puJled his shirt collar down. Two faded scars ran along the side of his neck. &quot;He wanted blood.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;You killed him?&quot; North asked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I shot him and he fell out of a window. But when I went to look...he was gone.1&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Bullshit,nWhite said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;I was there!I know what I saw!&quot; Doc said. &quot;Superstitiousbullshit.&quot; Some of the soldiers began to laugh.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Maybe your patient was a madman, doctor. Or maybe you&#39;re just a bad shot. But there are no such things as vampires.&quot; White walked over to where the campfire once burned. &quot;There is a simple explanation for what happened here.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The Colonel squatted down and picked up a burnt stick and started digging into the cold, black ashes.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Two dumb, old cowboys made camp in Indian territory. And were murdered for it.n White snapped the stick in half. &quot;Nothing more,&quot; he whispered to the air.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Then where is all the blood?&quot; North asked. White stood up.&quot;What?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There&#39;s no bloodon the ground,&quot; North lookedaround. &quot;Or on any of the cat tle. Where&#39;d it go?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">White was impatient. &quot;We&#39;re still missing one cowboy, Marshal. We don&#39;t have any more time for nonsense. What&#39;s your point?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think we shouldcheck the cave,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">White laughed.&quot;What for?&quot; The Colonel glanced at his soldiers. &quot;Vampires?&quot; The whole squadron began to laugh.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Vampire bats!Colonel, surelyeven you have heard of them!&quot; Northsaid. white stopped laughing, but his soldiers continued, even harder at the insult. &quot;Shut-up, you morons!&quot; White shouted angrily.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">There was silence.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">white briskly walked over to North and stopped only a couple of feet from his face, &quot;This isn&#39;t Central America, Marshal. There aren&#39;t any bats here like those.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It won&#39;t hurl to look,&quot; North insisted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">&quot;There&#39;s no time for that. The celebration is only two days away. If word should getout that there has been an Indian attack, everything will be ruined.n White took a step closer.&quot;And you wouldn&#39;t want to hurt Rose, would you?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;You can&#39;t kill innocent people over this. You don&#39;t have any proof,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re savages! And the proof is all around you!&quot; &quot;Why Indians? Why not outlaws?!&quot; North asked. &quot;Outlaws steal cattle, Marshal. They don&#39;t kill them,&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Neither do Indians. They would have eaten these animals. They&#39;ve been starvingever since we killed off the buffalo.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Then they should have stayed on the reservations where we put theml&quot; White said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North got in White&#39;s face, &quot;Maybe they don&#39;t want to be your slaves!&quot; White drew his sword, &quot;You damn Yankee!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North pulled out his revolver just as quickly/Murderer!&quot; &quot;Jim!&quot; Doc got in between them. North kept his eyes on White.&quot;What?&quot; &quot;Maybe he&#39;s right,&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What?!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Look,&quot; Doc pointed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North looked over White&#39;s shoulder toward the hills. Along the ridge, three Indians on horseback watched them. In the middle, the chief wore a buffalo headdress.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">White turned and spit on the ground, &quot;Savages.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Later in an Indian village, children were havingfun. Young braves chased one another around the teepees while a small group of girls played pretend with their primitive dolls.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Throughout the camp, women were making clothing and cooking food over open Arcs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">On a distant hill, two men on horseback watched the village. One of the men held a spyglass to his right eye. &quot;I don&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary, sir. Just women and children,&quot; the Major said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Give me that!&quot; White snatched the small telescope. &quot;The men must be awayon a hunt,&quot; the Major added. White desperately searched around until he found what he was looking for. uYou fool. They&#39;re preparing for war.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Sir?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">White observed some women and childrencollecting thingsaround the river. &quot;Can&#39;t you see anything? They&#39;re gathering wood and stones,&quot; White pointed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;For what, sir?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Weapons. Arrows, lances, tomahawks,&quot; White said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Over in another part of the camp, women and children were fastening arrow heads to wooden shafts. Others</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">were making various weapons.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">White put the eyepiece down, &quot;They&#39;re goingto attack the town.&quot; &quot;But what for, sir?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;A slaughter. In a couple of days the town will be fllled with people. That&#39;s when they&#39;ll attack,&quot; White said. &quot;Where are the men?&quot; the Major asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Reinforcements, Major. This is only a small band. They&#39;re gathering more men to wipe out the town.&quot; &quot;Are you sure, sir?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Are you questioning your superior, Major?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;No, sir,&quot; the Major answered unwilling to cross the Colonel.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Besides, it happened before. In Lawrence, in eighteen-seventy-two. The town was ambushed. Everyone was killed,&quot; White said with anger.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;But wasn&#39;t that revenge, sir? A young Indian boy was murdered for a crime he didn&#39;t commit,&quot; the Major said cautiously.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;I think I know my history, Major!&quot; &quot;Sorry, sir.&quot; While looked down on the busy village.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Beneath the full moon and stars, North and Doc rode into town. Heavy fog drifted down main street. Everything appeared to be calm andquiet.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The lights were onin the general store where Rose was sweeping. North and Doc stopped and tied uptheir horses.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Theyentered, but Rose was sobusy that shedidn&#39;t see them. &quot;Evening, Rose,&quot; North said. startled, she jumped.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;I didn&#39;t hear you,&quot; Rose felt her chest pounding. &quot;You scared me half to death.&quot; &quot;Sorry.&quot; North looked around.&quot;How&#39;s Mark?&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Rose startedsweepingagain.&quot;Okay, I guess. He&#39;s sleeping.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose stopped sweeping, &quot;What doyou mean? I thought it was Indians?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s what the Colonel said,&quot; Northstated.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose seemed confused,&quot;Well, what else is there?&quot; &quot;Bats,&quot; Doc said. &quot;Bats?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The cattle were bled to death. The problem is...we can&#39;t find any blood,n North explained.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;It may be a huge colony of vampire bats,n Doc said. Rose went back to work, &quot;In this area? Are you sure?&quot; &quot;We&#39;re not sure of anything. But they might be hiding in Devil&#39;s Cave,&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose stared at North, &quot;But the celebration is in two days. What are you going to do about it?&quot; North tookoff his hat and scratched his head, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Irritated by the answer, Rose swept evenharder, &quot;I see!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc noticed a stagecoach pulling up in front of the church. A man dressed in black got out. He waved the driver on before heading inside.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s Father Malone. He&#39;s back,&quot; Doc said to North.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North put his hat back on, &quot;Good, I want him to take a look at those marks on the body.&quot; &quot;What body? Who died?&quot; Rose asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Northlooked at her strangely, &quot;Dalton...the cowboy.&quot; &quot;You mean the one who almost killed Mark?&quot; she asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose shook her bead,&quot;He&#39;s not dead.&quot; North and Doc both said,&quot;What?!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Earlier, I saw him going into the saloon. He looked pale as a ghost, but he was definitely not dead,&quot; Rose said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The whole room was destroyed. Books, medical tools, and furniture had been thrown about. Doc ignored it all, except for an emptybed,&quot;He&#39;s gone.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North joined bis side. He reached down and picked up a blood dried ban danna. &quot;So much for Indians,&quot; he</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Maybe he wasn&#39;t dead,n Doc said. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Maybe I was wrong.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;No, be was dead alright. Dead as a man can be,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Doc grabbed his shotgun out of a comer and cocked it. &quot;There&#39;s only one way to find out.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">North and Doc entered the smoke filled saloon. The piano was loud as cow boys and prostitutes danced</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">about. Others played blackjack and poker.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Dalton was no where in sight. North looked to the bar where a big burly man with a huge mustache was cleaning glasses.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Sam!&quot; North shouted above the noise.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Howdy, Marshal. Can I get you something to drink?&quot; Sam asked. &quot;No. Have youseen anystrangersin here lately?&quot; North asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Sam laughed.&quot;Oh, about a hundred.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I mean a cowboy. The one on the runaway horse.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Sam nodded, &quot;Yeah, I heard be was dead, then he came in demanding one of the girls.&quot; &quot;He was dead,&quot; Doc said. &quot;What?!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Never mind,&quot; Northsaid, eyeing Doc.&quot;Is he still here?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Sam pointedto the ceiling.&quot;Yeah, he&#39;s upstairs with one of the girls.&quot; &quot;What room?&quot; North urged. &quot;Is he in some kind of trouble?&quot;Sam asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">From upstairs, a woman screamed. The whole saloon went quiet.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;No, but we are. Now what room?!&quot; Northsaid, grabbing Sam by the collar. &quot;Thirteen.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North and Doc ran up the stairs anddown a long hallway. &quot;Ten, eleven, twelve...here it is,&quot; North said. Doc banged on the door. Inside, an animal growled.&quot;Dalton!You in there?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Footsteps rushed the door and something heavy rammed it. startled, North and Doc jumped back. &quot;We&#39;re coming to get you and this town and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it,&quot;an evil voice said. &quot;Dalton, open the doorI&quot; North demanded.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Evil laughter fllled the air and the footsteps retreated. Glass shattered and then there was silence. &quot;What now?&quot; Doc asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Stand back.&quot; North kicked in the door and the two men entered with guns ready.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The room smelled horrible, but the sight was even worse. The place was painted in blood. The floor, ceiling, and walls were soaked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">on the blood stained bed, a young girl barely moved. Doc ran over to her side and turned up the kerosene lamp on the wall.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Son-of-a-bitch!&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">North couldn&#39;t see over Doc&#39;s bunched frame, &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Her head&#39;s missing!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The prostitute&#39;s bodysuddenly sat up.Her bloodcakedfingers reached out for Doc&#39;s throat. &quot;Jim!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North aimed, but didn&#39;t fire as the convulsing body collapsed to the floor. Doc was shaking, &quot;We&#39;r-e gonna need Father Malone!He&#39;ll know what to do!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North walked over to the broken window. Past the wind blown drapes and fog, he saw a bright orangeglow. &quot;Doc! The church is on fireI&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The wooden building was burning all the way up to the cross steeple. Men and boys hadformed a line passing buckets of water from the river, hopelessly fighting alosing battle.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North ranto the front doors of the church, but they were locked.&quot;Father Mal one!&quot; he shouted.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Noanswer. He stepped back andpulled out his revolvers. Within seconds, he shot the doors wide open. Amongst the fire and chaos, be ran down the aisle, his bandana over his mouth and nose, toward the altar, North shouted through the smoke, &quot;Father Malone!Where are you?!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Above the altar was a giant wooden statue of Jesus crucified. Two huge streams of blood ran from the neck down the length of the body.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North ran out, meeting Doc at the bottom of the steps, &quot;He&#39;s gone!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc took North by the arm and led him toward a large blood stain on the ground.&quot;Look!&quot; Doc pointed. J3loody boot prints ledaway into the darkness, thensuddenly disappeared.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I think Dalton took him!&quot; Doc saidu. But where?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">North stared out into the distance. Devil&#39;s Cave glowed in the heavy moon light.&quot;There!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">......</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Through the dense fog a small light appeared. A large plume of smoke rose into the moonlit sky.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Racing down the tracks, a steam locomotive pulled a long series of colorful cars. Along its side is a giant banner.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">THE MERCURY CIRCUS</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE UNIVERSE.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The circus family ate in the dining car. There was laughter and cigarette smoke. Glasses and dishes clanked as the strange group socialized.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;So where next?&quot; a clown asked the ringmaster.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Halisbury,&quot; the man with a tophat said with a mouth full of food. &#39;&#39;Never heard of it,&quot;the clownshrugged. &quot;Small town. Nothing much.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">A gladiator held up a glass of red wine, &quot;Who cares? As long as there&#39;s wine and women, eh?&#39;&#39; All the men at the table agreed andlaughed. suddenly...</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Silence!&quot; a woman shouted.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The group grew quiet andpeered down at the end of the table. Asmall,gypsy- like woman stared into a crystal ball</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What is it, Medusa?&quot; the ringma.ster asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">The old hag&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Something&#39;s coming.&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">From the locomotive&#39;s cab, the engineer saw a giant object gliding across the full moon. He stood up from his seat andstuck his head out the open window.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What in heaven?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Two hundred yards away, a black saucer hovered just above the tracks. &quot;That ain&#39;t no train.&quot; The engineer panicked and turned a small valve handle.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">A shrill whistle blew.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">From the animal cars, the circus creatures became uneasy. Nervously, they paced back and forth in their cages.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The dining car was de.ad silent as the whistle blew again. &quot;This ain&#39;t funny,&quot; the clown said. &quot;Something evil comes this way,&quot; Medusa prophesied.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Whal? Indians? outlaws?&quot; the gladiator asked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The engineer saw a spiraling light from the unidentified object, &quot;Chariot of fire!&quot; The circus animals sensed danger. They began to jumpand tear at the bars.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I see a greenlight,&quot; Medusa said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Angry, the ringmaster stood up and shouted, &quot;Tell us what it is, witch!&quot; Medusa shouted back,&quot;Something not of this world!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Describe it then!&quot; the gladiator slammed his fist on the table.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Frustrated, Medusa grabbed a plate full of food and dumped it on the floor. She then flipped the empty dish on topof another.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The clown took it and held it upfor all to see,&quot;Some sort of disc.&quot; &quot;A ship!&quot; Medusa blurted.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Aship?!&quot; the ringmaBter huffed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;There&#39;s no water out here!&quot; the gladiator insisted. &quot;A flyingship!&quot; Medusa continued.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;She&#39;s gone mad!&quot; the ringmaster said to the others. Inside the cabin, the candle light flickered.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The engineer watched as the green light continued to grow into some sort of enormous funnel Impact was certain. Desperate, he grabbed the emergency brake valve.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">But before be could turn it, the green light flaBhed in his eyes. His pupils di lated and spun. Evil voices filled</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">his head.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Join us! Join us!&quot; they chanted.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The engineer released the valve. The train sped on.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Unable to escape, the circus animals went mad. Elephants, tigers, and mon keys bit and tore one another</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">apart.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The whole circus family was terrified by all the noise. Glasses and dishes shook along the table as the candles flickered off and on.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Everyone looked to Medusa for an answer. But as the old woman gazed into the future, her crystal ball leapt out of her hands. Defore anyone could catch it</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">I</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">it fell and shattered along the floor.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What is it, Medusa?!&quot; the ringmaster demanded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Horrified, the gypsy woman stood up;&quot;Death!&quot; The cabin&#39;s lightswent out.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">A flood of green light collided with the train, swallowing it whole. Screams, both manand beast filled the air for miles.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The train vanished.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">There was only silence except for the distant howl of a coyote.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Then, in the darkness, a hydraulic door opened. Green light spilled out onto the raihoad tracks. A steam engine built up speed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Covered with an eerie green glow, the locomotive and its cars left the ramp. Back on the tracks, it headed</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">into the night past a small, wooden sign:&quot;HALIS BURY 1 MILE&quot;.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North and Doc left their horses at the bottom of the hill beneath Devil&#39;s Cave. carrying torches and guns, they climbed past the trees until they reached the mammoth opening.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">on a ledge, they stopped to catch their breath.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc bent over with his hands on his knees, &quot;There&#39;s no way he could get here this fast. I mean we took horses and he was carrying a man.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North looked off the ledge toward Halisbury. In the distance, he saw the church fire barely burning. Hesuddenly noticed something at his feet.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">He squatted and ran his torch along the sandy floor, &quot;Footprints.&quot; &#39;&#39;What?&quot; Doc said in disbelief. &quot;Boots. Coming from nowhere.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Doc searched around, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; &quot;Positive.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The prints appeared to start at the tip of the ledgeand head toward thecave. &quot;Re&#39;sin there. Somewhere,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Doc looked over theledge at a three-hundred-foot freefall. &quot;What&#39;d be do? Fly?&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Let&#39;s find out.&quot; North led the way but noticed that Doc stop.ped ju.st short of the entrance.&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Docstared into the vast darkness,&quot;I&#39;m afraid.n</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North smiled and put his hand on Doc&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Of the dark?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he smiled back. &quot;Just what&#39;s in it.&quot; &quot;You don&#39;t have to dothls.n</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I know,&quot; Docexhaled. &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The two men entered the dark, damp place. They followed the footprints alonga narrow pathway between strange, oddly shaped r,ocks. Northand Doc&#39;s breath began to show.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;It&#39;s freezing in here!&quot; Docrubbed his arms. &quot;Yeah, like ice,&quot; North agreed. They entered a large chamber and soon forgot about the cold.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;My God,&quot; Doccouldn&#39;t believe his eyes. &quot;Look at it all.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Like a storage room.&quot; Doc saw a stagecoach, covered wagons andseveraltrain cars allcovered with dried blood.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;How&#39;d it get here?&quot; North was nervous.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Doc looked to the empty ceiling, &quot;It sure wasn&#39;t bats.&quot; &quot;Or Indians,&quot; North added.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;We&#39;re gonna need help. Maybe we should get the Colonel?&quot; &quot;He won&#39;t believe us. Besides, we can&#39;t leave Father Malone.&quot; Doc was terrified, &quot;He&#39;s dead!You know that.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">A man&#39;s scream echoed in the distance. &quot;This way!&quot; North ran.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc reluctantly followed North into a larger chamber. The footprints sud- denly ended in the middle of the giant room.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Both men turned in circles, but found nothing. &quot;He&#39;s disappeared,&quot; North noted. Doc saw something huge along the walls.&quot;Look!&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc moved in closer with his torch,&quot;Wall paintings.&quot; There were hundreds of primitive pictures. &quot;Looks like some kind of story,&quot; North said. &quot;Indian legends,&quot; Doc.said,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Their torches revealed askyfull of stars. The sun, moon, and earth stood out. &quot;What is the green one, there?&quot; North pointed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;A falling star...heading toward earth?&quot; Doc guessed,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">North noticed that the star landed near an Indian village. &quot;No, it&#39;s some sort of ship,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Strange creatures attacked the tribe and appeared to he drinking their blood, Doc turned to North,.&quot;Looks familiar.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Next, the Indians are making arrows and spears. They chanted and moved</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">around a huge picture of thunderstorms. &quot;What are they doing?&quot; North asked. &quot;A rain dance. It&#39;s some sort of...,&quot; Blood dripped on Doc&#39;s face. &quot;Jim!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North raised his torch towardthe ceiling. On a ledge was Dalton,gorging him</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">self on Father Malone&#39;s blood.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">North aimed his gun, &quot;Let him go, Dalton!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The blood covered cowboy stood up. North and Doc couldn&#39;t believe their eyes. Dalton&#39;s skin was greenish- white. His eyes were blank and his ears pointed,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m through with him,n Dalton wiped his mouth, He then picked up the priest&#39;s lifeless body and held it over his head,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;You can have him!&quot; He threw the dead man.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Look out!&quot; North yelled. He pushed Doc out of the way as the body slammed on the ground, then rolled into</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">a giant sinkhole. North tried to stop it from fall ing, but lost his footing and slid in.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">&quot;Gotcha!&quot; Doc snared North&#39;s hand as the Marshal&#39;s torch followed the body into the pit. Bothmenlooked down, seeing hundreds of skeletal remains ofthe alien creatures.In the middle of the mass grave, Father Malone&#39;s body was cru cified on a sharp pillar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Pull yourself up!I can&#39;t hold on muchlonger!&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Evil laughter filled the air.Doclooked over his shoulder and saw Daltonleap ing off the ledge at him.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North watched the cowboy fly toward them at a high speed. With his free hand, he pulled out his revolver and fired. Bullets filled the vampire&#39;s legs, arms andhead.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Daltonlanded on bis feet as Doc pulled North up.

Barely conscious, Docgrabbed his shotgun. &quot;Let him go!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Dalton released North whostruggled to catch his breath. The cowboy turned on Doc,&quot;Who says?&quot; &quot;Doctor&#39;s orders!&quot; Doc pulled the trigger and blew a hole through Dalton&#39;s chest. His beating, black heart shattered along the cavern wall. Dalton sttun bled back, tripping over North and fell into the pit.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Doc rushed to North&#39;s side.&quot;You okay?&quot; &quot;Shotgun, huh?&quot; North smiled.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t want to miss.&quot; He helped North up, &quot;What next?&quot; North rubbed his throat.&quot;Dynamite.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">.....</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">The next day.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Fort Sharpe, a giant army post, was quiet by the river.

Barely conscious, Docgrabbed his shotgun.&quot;Let him go!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Dalton released North whostruggled to catch his breath.

His beating, black heart</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">shattered along the cavern wall. Dalton shun bled back, tripping over North and fellinto the pit.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Doc rushed to North&#39;s side.&quot;You okay?&quot; &#39;&#39;Shotgun, huh?&quot; North smiled.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t want to miss.&quot; He helped North up,&quot;What next?&quot; North rubbed his throat.&quot;Dynamite.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The next day.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Fort Sharpe, a giant army post, was quiet by the river.

Maybe we&#39;ll get lucky. Maybe he&#39;llfall in love and leave.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Guard number two laughed, &quot;The Colonel? Love?&quot; He laughed even harder. &quot;No, the only thing that bastard knows is control. That lady, that town and this fort.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">An angry cry filled the air. Frightened, the two guards stood up and looked over the wall. In the distance, an Indian chief wearing a buffalo headdress paced backand forth on horseback.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What doeshe want?&quot; guard number one asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The chieflet out another blood curdlingcry. Hestopped his horse and held up a baby&#39;s papoose covered in blood.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Looks like he found his village/ guard twosaid. The two soldiers ducked behind the wall. &quot;Let&#39;s get the others,&quot; guard one said. &quot;For one Indian?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The twosoldiers cocked their rifles.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Are you ready?&quot; said guard two. &quot;Ready.&quot; &quot;Let&#39;s doit.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The two men stood up and aimed over the wall. Suddenly their hnnds froze. Hundreds of Indians stood there. War paint, rlricd blood, covered their ngry faces.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What now?!&quot; shouted gu rd one.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Signal the troops, then prepare to die,&quot; said guard two.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">InHalisbury, the circus train was parked just outside the edge of town. Cages filled with wild animals were</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">unloaded. Workers and elephants set upan enor mous tent.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Swiftly riding toward town, North and Doc noticed something strange about the circus crew. They all moved about as if they were hypnotized or sleepwalk ing. But the two men didn&#39;t have time to investigate, so they rode on.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">In town, the celebration was on. Main street was full of people. Music was in the air and the merchants were</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">busy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">North and Doc rode up to the general store. Doc watched the horses while North rushed in.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">In the back, Rose was ringing up a huge sale with a customer. North walked behind the counter and grabbed her by the arm.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&#39;&#39;Excuse us,&quot; North said to the customer. North pulled Rose away and toward the front door. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;I want you and Mark to leave town right now.&quot; Halfway through the store, Rose pulled away,&quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Three people are dead!And there&#39;s going to be more,&quot; North said loudly. The whole store grew quiet. Everyonestopped shopping and looked on.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Please keep your voice down. You&#39;re scaring the customers,&quot; Rose whis- pered. &quot;There won&#39;t be any customers or a town if we don&#39;t do something quick,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Frustrated, Rose turned to a young girl standing behind one of the counters. uLaura, watch the store. I&#39;ll be right back,&quot;she said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Rose turned to North and pointedto the dooru, outside, please.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Across the street, the saloon was full of song and dance. Standing at the bar, colonel white enjoyed a drink and a cigarette. He turned and looked out the window. In front of the general store, Rose was talking with North and Doc. she was visibly upset.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">White&#39;s face went sour. He downed his drink and crushed his smoke beneath his boot. &quot;Jim, you&#39;re not making any sense,&quot; Rose said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">11I know, but trust me. You and Mark have to leave now,&quot; North insisted. White appeared. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;The town is in danger,&quot; Northsighed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">White frowned, &quot;I&#39;ve already taken care of that.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North hadn&#39;t heard about the attack on the village. &quot;This isn&#39;t about Indians. Last night, Dalton killed two people. I&#39;ve got a feeling that tonight there&#39;s going to be more.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I thought he died in your office,&quot; White saidto Doc.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;So did we. But whatever bit him, turned him into some kind of monster.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;We found Father Malone in Devil&#39;s cave. Dalton was drinking his blood,&quot; North explained. White&#39;s eyebrows raised, &quot;Likea vampire,right?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North became angry. Hedidn&#39;t have time for White&#39;s bullshit.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;You can call it whatever the hell you want, but it took seven shots to bring himdown.&quot; White held his hands up,&quot;Listen to yourselves. There&#39;s nosuch creaturefrom around here.&quot; &quot;Exactly,&quot; North agreed. &quot;They came from the sky in some kind of flying craft.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">White laughed, &quot;And who told you this crap?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Doc pointed to Devil&#39;s Cave, &quot;The Indians. There&#39;s painting and drawings on the walls.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">White shook his head,&quot;They&#39;re just stories, man, made upby medicine mento keep the tribe under control.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s history,&quot; North said,&quot;These creatures have been here before.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We found a grave full of their skeletons. Enough to fill this street,&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;The Indians know how to beat these things. We may need their help,&quot; North said to White. &quot;Impossible,&quot; white grunted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Why?&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re dead,&quot; White grinned.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;You murdered innocent people?&quot; North asked. &quot;Unfortunately, only half.&quot; Furious, North approached White, &quot;You son-of-a-bi killed!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Rose·blocked North,&quot;Jim, what do you want from us?&quot; &quot;Dynamite,&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Dynamite?&quot; she asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;We have to seal the cave. It may be our only hope.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s nothing like that around here,nshe said. Northlooked to White, &quot;Well, colonel? What about the fort?&quot; White held his band up,&quot;I&#39;m not goingto help any madmen.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s what I figured,&quot; North turned to Doc,&quot;We&#39;ll have to go</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;But that&#39;.s five•miles away,&quot; Rose said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Northfaced Rose, takingher by the arms,&quot;That&#39;s why I want youand Markto come with me. I think you&#39;ll be safe there.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">Rose pulled away, &quot;No, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened to you but this all sounds crazy to me. I&#39;m not going anywhere.&quot; Upset, Rose headed into the store. North started to follow her but White blocked the entrance. &quot;You heard her. Leave.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">North turned to Doc, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Bothmen got on their horses. &quot;We have to get there andback before dark,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">White smiled, &quot;You&#39;ll never make it.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The sun sat low in the west as North and Doc rode into Bracken. Main street was dead. No people. Nohorses. Nosound. Cautiously, North and Doc entered.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There&#39;s no one here,&quot; Doc said. &quot;Lil&lt;c a ghost town,&quot; North said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">They rode past the general store that was full of me tomers. &quot;Not a soul,&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;And nothing taken,&quot; Northsaid. &quot;What&#39;d you think happened?&quot; Doc asked. &quot;I don&#39;t know. But towns don&#39;t just disappear,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">They rode on, passing a barber shop, saloon and a small school. Everything&#39; was quiet except for the wind howling through the cracks and crevices.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc suddenly stopped when he saw the church. He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. Nothing but the frame was left.The interior was burnt to ashes.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Just like before,&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Yeah. Someone doesn&#39;t like churches,&quot; North said. &quot;You don&#39;t think it was...&quot; &quot;Dalton?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Doc swallowed hard,&quot;Maybe he isn&#39;t dead.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Let&#39;s just find the dynamite.&#39;&#39; North snapped the reins and to Doc behind. &quot;Wait up!&quot; Doc yelled.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North and Doc stopped at the Marshal&#39;s office and tied their horses. &quot;He ain&#39;t gonna be here. Nobody&#39;s here,&quot; Doc said nervously.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I know,&quot; North yanked out his revolver.&quot;Bring your gun.&quot; Doc grabbed bis shotgun offhis saddle.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">They walked in finding the place empty. On top of a desk was a pool of some thing red.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;That&#39;s blood alright,&quot; Doc said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The two men moved along the creaking floorboards. Something beneath it awakens. It&#39;s blank eyes open and watch the intruders.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North went behind the desk. There was blood on the chair and floor. He stepped on something. &quot;What is it?&quot; Doc asked.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Look!&quot; Doc pointed to the jailcell. The bars hadbeenstretchedfar enough for a man to squeeze through. &quot;What didthat?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Under the floor, long nails pulled something along the ground until it was directly beneath Doc. North opened a desk drawer and pulledout a match. He struck it alongthe top andlit a lantern. &quot;What&#39;re you doing?&quot; Doc asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Northlooked out the window. &quot;It&#39;s gonna be dark soon.&quot; &quot;We&#39;re leaving, aren&#39;t we?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Not until we find some dynamite.&quot; North took the lantern and went out the door. Doc hesitated until he beard something beneath him.He ran.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">They walked down mainstreet. &quot;Where wegoing?&quot; Doc asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;The general store. There might be some in storage,&quot;North said. The sun quickly sank beneath the distant black hills.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc was afraid, &quot;The Colonel was right.&quot; &quot;About what?&#39;&#39; &quot;We ain&#39;t gonna make it.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Well the Colonel cango straight to...&quot; On the second floor of the hotel, North saw a womanin a nightgown race by one of the windows. &quot;Did you see that?!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Doc was terrified. &#39;&#39;What?!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">North held up the lantern, &quot;There was someone up there.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Theystopped in the middle of the road. Doc looked up but saw only a window. &quot;Hello!Is anyone up there?!&quot; North yelled.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">No answer. No movement.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Let&#39;s go home,&quot; Doc&#39;s voice broke.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Darkness consumed the town. The full moon rose. Suddenly, the sleeping buildings seemed to come to life. They shifted, creaked and moaned.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">A strange green fogslowly drifted up through the wooden floors and rolled out into the street.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Jim{&quot;·</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Demonic voicesfilled the.air.&quot;Join us...Join us:&#39;&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">.sinister shadows moved about in the dense fog. .Mouth_s full of° were ready to feed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">In the barber shop, a bald-headed manappeared, carrying a strai smiled, revealin,glong canine teeth.. &quot;You boys want a cut?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North fired his gun six times into the vampire&#39;s hea smoke cleared, the angry barber charged him. &quot;Jim,look outt&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North triedto reload, but didn&#39;t have time.

He aimed his gun at North, uLeaving sosoon?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">A boom rang out from Doc&#39;s shotgun. The blast decapitated the lawman. His body fell and convulsed about the sidewalk.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Disturbed, the other vampires looked up from their feeding. Still hungry, theycharged Doc.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Hold on!&quot; North yelled as he popped the horse with the reigns, sending the already nervous animal into a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">gallop.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Hurryt&quot; Doc shouted:</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The vampires surrounded Doc as he tried to reload. suddenly, North ran over two.of_them.The others turnedto attack his horse, but the beaststomped them into the ground andkicked the others through the air. &quot;Come on!&quot; North said. He reached down andtook Doc&#39;s hand and pulled him up onto the back of the steed. The vampires advanced once more, but not before North racedaway through the burning town. On their way out, they passed Neal, Dalton&#39;s old sidekick, who warned them.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;There&#39;s no place to go!We already have your town!&quot; North rode on. &#39;&#39;What does that mean?&quot; Doc asked while looking back.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">North pushed the horse even harder,fearing the worst, &quot;The circus!&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Inside the circus tent, the coliseum-like seating was fllled to capacity. Rose, White and Mark sat together. A band played the &#39;circus theme&#39; to start the show. But the notes were very eerie.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">In the center ring, the dirt floor was lit byaspiralling greenlight.A manwith a blacktop hat appeared from nowhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Laaadeeeez and gentlemen--for the next two hours you will see things you have never witnessed before.&quot; His smile was evil.&quot;So welcome to the greatest show...in the universe!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">There was a montage of acts. Clowns walked around the crowd on giantstilts, juggling knives, axes, and torches. One clown in particular went up to Mark and smiled, revealing razor sh.arp teeth.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Trapeze artists flew through the air over pits of crocodiles and snakes. A strongman lifted a cage holding an elephant over his head. Another man with a whip, worked with a pack of wolves.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">st.range c.reatures from other worlds performed all kinds of tricks in three separate rings.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Death battles between anjmals and men horrified the audience. People gasped and covered their eyes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;My God, what is this?&quot; R.ose asked white. &quot;We&#39;releaving.&quot; &quot;Do we haveto?&quot; Markasked enjoyingthe mayhem.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Yes!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose took Mark&#39;s hand and dragged him down the stands. Colonel White followed. As they approached the exit, they heard a mechanical noise. A.steel door that was once a ramplifted upward.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re locking us in!&quot; Rose said. The metal door slammed shut.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Now for our final performance!&quot; The Ringmaster held out his arms. &quot;You! The audience...&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">A giant green light floated in the air like a balloon. Bigger and bigger it grew until it finally exploded. Filling the air, hundreds of flying vampires charged the stands.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;...Will die!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">People panicked and screamed. Some were trampled to death. Suddenly, the stadium seats collapsed creating a giant funnel. Many of the people slid i.nto the center ring where they were ripped apart.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Behind the stands, White watched the blood bath. He pulled out his sword and pushed Rose and Mark into the shadows.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Wait here!&quot; he said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">White charged into battle, slicing the attackers into pieces. But soon he was overwhelmed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Rose and Mark heard a gyrating sound. The tent trembled and shook. It sud denlybegan to lift.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">An enormous spaceship ripped up through the circus tent. Rose looked out a circular window and watched as the townslowly disappeared.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North and Doc rode in and saw the flying craft leaving. Rose looked down uponthem, but her screams couldn&#39;t beheard.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;They&#39;re beading to Devil&#39;s Cave!&quot; Doc shouted. &quot;We&#39;re gonna need help!&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Smoke billowed from Fort Sharpe into the moonlit sky.Some of the buildings and watchtowers were still burning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Inside, Soldiers were covered with arrows and tomahawks. Heads were crushed and throats were cut. &quot;They&#39;ve been slaughtered,&quot; Doc said. &quot;It&#39;s called revenge,&quot; North whispered.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North entered a storage building and searched around while Doc waited outside.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Now thanks to ourlovable Colonel...we&#39;re on our own,&#39;1 North said. &quot;But we don&#39;t stand a chance against those things.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;Sure we do,&quot; North said. Frominside the storage building, he threw out lum- ber, nails and a couple of hammers.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What are we goingto do? Build them a jail?&quot; Doc asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">North came out carrying a crate on his shoulder,&quot;You might say that.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">He sat the crate onto a wagon. Doc approached, seeing large, black letters along the side. &quot;DYNAMITE,&quot; be read.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North walked over to a cannon and checked the muzzle, &quot;O fine.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Dowhat, :fine?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve got an idea.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Above the mammoth opening of Devil&#39;s Cave, sticks of dynamite laid strate gically in the rocks.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Deep inside, in the darkness, the two figures worked by the light of a single torch.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">with hammers, North and Doc quickly pounded wooden crosses into the dirt floor. Almost a hundred surrounded them.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Doc stopped to catch his breath, &quot;Are you sure this is going to work?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North stuck the final cross into the ground, &quot;No. But I do know one thing...H He drove the cross deep into the earth with one mighty blow &quot;...they don&#39;t like churches.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">From the main cave behind them, a whip cracked and n female screamed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">one by one, the citizens ofHalisbury marched out. &quot;There she is,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose and Mark walked out unscathed but very afraid. &quot;I don&#39;t see the Colonel,&quot; Doc said. &quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; North said without emotion.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Rose, Mark and all the others were marched toward other humans who were digging out dirt and removing stones.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Look at all those people,&quot; Docsaid.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Slaves-from all over the county,&quot; North said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What are they building?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">A huge sculpture of an alien&#39;s face adorned one wall. He looked to be some kind of king.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Stone steps led up to an opulent temple where a great idol of a giant bat stood seventy feet tall</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Hundreds of smaller caves lined the walls in between stone heads and stat ues.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Some kind of city,&quot; North said.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Guards with razor sharp teeth perched on the citywalls.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">&quot;There&#39;s a thousand of them-at least,&quot; Doclooked into North&#39;s eyes. &quot;We can do it,&quot; North answered. &quot;Are you crazy?

As the gun smoke cleared, the vampire&#39;s headless body slowly fell away, spi ralling into the darkness.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Off balance, North rolled down the hard steps and landed at the feet of the king and que.en. In one hand, he still held the stick of dynamite, but the other was empty. He found his burning torch only a fewfeet away.

North fell on top of Doc, shielding him fromthe falling debris.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">But as the smoke cleared, hundreds still remained. They charged! &quot;Run,Doc!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The two men quickly lost ground to their assailants until they crossed over the rock bridge and into the area filled with crosses.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">North stopped, &quot;Look!It&#39;s working1n</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The raging vampires stopped well short, hissing and cursing the humans.

From his pants pocket, he pulled out three matches.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This is all we got,&quot; he saidto Doc.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">He took one andstruck it against a rock.

He</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">looked along the staff, finding his attacker approaching on horseback. The Indian chief watched as White&#39;s body wasconsumed by flames. &quot;Savage!&quot; Whiteyelled, then his body exploded topieces.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Doc...hold on!Tell mewhat to do!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Doc raised up andwhispered into hisear,&quot;Lightthe match.&quot; Hethen fell back, dead. &quot;No!

The Queen smiled,enjoying hisgrief. North reachedinto his pocket andpulledout the last match. He held it in the air for Her to see. He then took off.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">Across the battlefield hefled, ducking and dodging as the shipfired at him. A large, juniper shrub appeared and North ran for it, leaping behind its cover.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">The mothership stopped directly in front of it and waited. The Queen didn&#39;t see anymovement.Her patience grew thin.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Fool!&quot; she barked, then to the helmsman, &quot;Kill him!&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">The ship fired!The juniper was engulfed in flames. Quickly, it disintegrated intosmoke and ashes.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">The Queen searched for bones but instead found North standing in the clear ing smoke. He held a lit match</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">and below it, a burningfuse disappeared into a largecannon. North smiled and tipped his hat.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Horrified, the Queen stared down into the long, black muzzle,&quot;NOii!!&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The civil war cannon fued!The force of the blast sent the weapon rolling back on its wheel .

The water&#39;s surface bubbled and boiled.

There was nothing but silence.Then... &quot;Jim!Youdid it! Youdid it!&quot; Rose ran to him. North walked away, not saying a word. Rose followed him across the battle- field, &quot;Jim?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">North stepped over skulls and bones, both manand beast.
